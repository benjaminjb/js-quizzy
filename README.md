##js-quizzy
=========

### Summary
A single-page application for quiz taking / making, written in JavaScript and related libraries (notably jQuery).

### Technical Toolbox

1. JavaScript
2. jQuery
3. localStorage
4. HTML, CSS

### Goals

1. Obtain greater mastery of JavaScript and related libraries;
2. Practice solving the unique issues of a single-page app;
3. Learn new tools of webpage development (like localStorage); and 
4. Think about new principles of design for single-page apps and for saving / retrieving information.

### Method

The original assignment for Quizzy was to create a quiz with correct answers; then we added some additional features around that general idea, including: the ability to save high scores and average results.

We then began to build Quizzy into a more dynamic app, where users could first create a quiz (saved locally), and then choose from among those quizzes. Each quiz would retain the functionality of the original quiz.

### Lessons learned

* How to save and retrieve data from localStorage;
* How to deal with JSON objects, including JSON.parse and JSON.stringify; 
* How to design a single-page application (fundamentals).

### Idea for extension

* Complete quiz making functionality
* Attach to persistent database, perhaps MongoDB
